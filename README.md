# 11ty-output-parent

Testing setting the output directory to a parent directory.

## USAGE

```sh
cd nested
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

Once the build has finished (and you go back to the parent directory), you should have both a "nested/" directory with our source code, and a "www/" directory with our generated output.
